Luj (pronounced as "luge") combines LuaJIT and Python
to speed up Python in a unique way; a pure scriptable
extension with no binary installation required. This
extension enables rapid speed up of Python code and ease of
sharing code amongst one another. The code is in alpha state
and is not recommended for mainstream use yet. 

Examples:
To run the examples, do so from the root directory of Luj. 
Like the following: 

$ python examples pi.py

This will show how much faster Python scripts can be using Luj.


Install:
This Python module is not setup to be installed yet. You can
run it from Luj's root directory by doing

>> import luj


Types:
Luj can currently handle integers, floats, lists, and 
dictionaries. It can parse a N-dimensional numpy array,
but interacting with the array in Lua table format is 
cumbersome at the moment. A update will soon follow to 
allow easier access to Numpy arrays.
