Luj (pronounced the same as luge) combines LuaJIT and Python
to speed up Python in a unique way; a pure scriptable
extension with no binary installation required. This
extension enables rapid speed up of Python code and ease of
sharing code amongst one another. In the next few weeks
alpha quality code will be uploaded for others to try.
